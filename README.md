# CC-Funnel-Analytics

Funnel Analytics is a component to allow creators to view several data points about how new players are interacting with their games. Creators can track up to 24 different steps in their games to get data on how to improve their games. This component also allows creators to  A / B test functionality in their game, view Day 1 retention percentage, and first play session times all without the creator ever having to be in their game.
